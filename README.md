## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass Preprocessor script language


### What I learned

I learned during this challenge to structure the scss files to find my way around and I also improved on the interpretation of the model.

Before I didn't know how to put the color with an opacity on top of an image background.



I put the background image in addition to background color and then use :
```css  
background-blend-mode: multiply; 
```
to make the background image blend with the background color, but the rendering is not the same as on the mockup.
 

Now I used the method Use of CSS pseudo-elements which allows to use the :before of an element which contains a background image to put on top of it a background in color with opacity.

it's thanks to a tutorial that I could find this trick I put the link in the "Useful resources" section.


### Continued development

When I was at the point of completing this challenge, I noticed that I was repeating media queries giving maximum and minimum sizes to each scss file and that I normally had to use variables to change the max and min widths.

the next challenge is to improve myself in **sass** and again on the **html & css** structure because still I find that I use too much margin and padding to space while there is the flex with gap 




### Useful resources

- [How to Change a CSS Background Imageâ€™s Opacity](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-change-a-css-background-images-opacity) - This helped to change a css Background Image opacity : this is what helped me to put a colored background with opacity over a background image
